A N*N matrix having N rows and N columns containing + or * for it's cell values is passed as the input. Two strings S1 and S2 are also passed as input. 
The program must search for * in a straight line (either left to right or top to bottom) and replace them with strings S1 and S2. 

Input Format: 
The first line will contain the value of N. The next N lines will contain the values for N rows having + and * representing the cell values of the matrix. 
The last two lines will contain the value of the two strings S1 and S2 respectively. 

Output Format: 
N lines with the matrix cell values containing * replaced by the characters in the string values S1 and S2. Constraints: 4 <= N <= 100 Length of S1 and S2 is from 2 to N.
