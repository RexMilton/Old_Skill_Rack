Binary Tree - Node Left and Right Child (Id-2936)

An array of N positive integers is passed as input. The program must form a binary search tree with these numbers. The first number (out of the N numbers passed as input) 
is the root node of the binary tree.
Then a number P which is present in these N numbers is passed as the input. The program must print the immediate left and right child values of the node belonging to P, 
with the values separated by a space.

Note: If the node is a leaf node then print -1. Else if only left or only right child is present, then print only the child that is present.

Input Format:
The first line contains N numbers, each separated by a space.
The second line contains P

Output Format:
The first line contains the values of left and right child separated by a space (or only left or right child value)

Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 9999
