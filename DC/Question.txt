Matrix Different Dimension HCF
The program must accept two integer matrices of size MxN and RxC as the input. The program must print the HCF of the integer values present in the intersecting area of 
the given two matrices.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= M, N, R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains M and N separated by a space.
The next M lines, each contains N integers separated by a space.
The (M+2)th line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The lines, each contains the integer values separated by a space.
