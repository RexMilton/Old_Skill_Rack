Linked List - deleteThirdNode

The function/method deleteThirdNode accepts an argument - head, it represents the head of a singly linked list.

The function/method deleteThirdNode must delete the 3rd node in the given singly linked list and then return the revised head of the singly linked list.

Your task is to implement the function deleteThirdNode so that it passes all the test cases.

Note: The number of nodes in the given linked list is always greater than or equal to 3.

The following structure is used to represent the Node and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in your code).


struct Node
{
    int val;
    struct Node *next;
};


IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
8 4 1 2 7

Output:
After deleting the third node: 8 4 2 7

Explanation:
After deleting the 3rd node in the given singly linked list, the list becomes 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7.
Hence the output is
8 4 2 7

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
50 40 20

Output:
After deleting the third node: 50 40
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
