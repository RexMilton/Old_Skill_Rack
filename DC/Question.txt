String Matrix to Character Matrix 

The program must accept a matrix of size RxC containing only words as the input. All words in the matrix have the same length as 9. 
The program must form a character matrix of size (R*3)x(C*3) by expanding the each word to a 3*3 character matrix based on the following conditions. 
- The 1st row of the 3*3 matrix must be formed using the first 3 characters of the word. 
- The 2nd row of the 3*3 matrix must be formed using the middle 3 characters of the word. 
- The 3rd row of the 3*3 matrix must be formed using the last 3 characters of the word. 
Finally, the program must print the character matrix as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= R, C <= 50 

Input Format: 

The first line contains R and C separated by a space. The next R lines, each contains C words separated by a space. 

Output Format: 

The first R*3 lines, each contains C*3 characters separated by a space. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

3 3 
skillrack chocolate IMPORTANT 
Knowledge Seventeen vegetable 
Crocodile nutrition Fireboard 

Output:

Explanation: 

Here R = 3 and C = 3. 
The word skillrack is expanded to a 3x3 character matrix as given below. 
s k i 
l l r 
a c k 
The word chocolate is expanded to a 3x3 character 
matrix as given below. 
c h o 
c o l 
a t e 

Similarly the remaining words are expanded to 3x3 character matrices. 
Hence the output is 

s k i c h o I M P
