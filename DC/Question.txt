Unfolded Cube Pattern
The program must accept 6 characters and an integer N as the input. The 6 characters represent the 6 faces of a cube as given below.
* 6 * *
4 1 2 3
* 5 * *
The integer N represents the size of each face (NxN grid) in the cube. The program must print the 6 faces of the cube in the unfolded cube format as mentioned above. 
The empty spaces in the unfolded cube must be printed as asterisks.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 20

Input Format:
The first line contains 6 characters separated by a space.
The second line contains N.

Output Format:
The first (3*N) lines, each contains (4*N) characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
a b c d e f
3

Output:
* * * f f f * * * * * *
* * * f f f * * * * * *
* * * f f f * * * * * *
d d d a a a b b b c c c
d d d a a a b b b c c c
d d d a a a b b b c c c
* * * e e e * * * * * *
* * * e e e * * * * * *
* * * e e e * * * * * *

Explanation:
Here N = 3, so the size of each face in the cube is 3*3.
The face 1 grid contains the character 'a'.
The face 2 grid contains the character 'b'.
The face 3 grid contains the character 'c'.
The face 4 grid contains the character 'd'.
The face 5 grid contains the character 'e'.
The face 6 grid contains the character 'f'.
The empty spaces are replaced with the asterisks.
Hence the output is
* * * f f f * * * * * *
* * * f f f * * * * * *
* * * f f f * * * * * *
d d d a a a b b b c c c
d d d a a a b b b c c c
d d d a a a b b b c c c
* * * e e e * * * * * *
* * * e e e * * * * * *
* * * e e e * * * * * *

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
S E A R C H
2

Output:
* * H H * * * *
* * H H * * * *
R R S S E E A A
R R S S E E A A
* * C C * * * *
* * C C * * * *
