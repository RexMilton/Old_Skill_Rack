Matrix - Identical Row and Column
The program must accept an integer matrix of size N*N as the input. The program must print YES if at least one row is identical to one column in the given matrix. Else 
the program must print NO as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
2 3 4 5
3 5 10 9
6 10 8 8
7 9 2 1

Output:
YES

Explanation:
2nd row and 2nd column of the given matrix are identical.
2 3 4 5
3 5 10 9
6 10 8 8
7 9 2 1
So YES is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
4 5 3
1 3 3
4 5 1

Output:
YES

Explanation:
2nd row and 3rd column(bottom to top) are identical.
4 5 3
1 3 3
4 5 1
So YES is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
5
94 54 52 97 81
54 87 92 35 72
52 35 94 63 23
97 35 87 63 76
80 72 18 72 10

Output:
NO
