Daily Challenge ProgramID- 12752 
String - Find the Sentence
The program must accept a string S and an integer P as the input. The string S represents a paragraph, where each dot (.) represents the end of a sentence in that paragraph. The integer P represents the position of a word in the string S. If the value of P is negative, then it indicates the position of a word in the string in reverse order. The program must print the sentence which contains the Pth word as the output.
Note: The value of P is always valid.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains P.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sentence which contains the Pth word.

Example Input/output 1:
Input:
I am a doctor. I know how to cure the disease. Take this medicine 3 times a day.
8

Output:
I know how to cure the disease.

Explanation:
Here P = 8.
There are 3 sentences in the given string.
The 8th word in the string is to, which is present in the 2nd sentence.
So the 2nd sentence is printed as the output.

Example Input/output 2:
Input:
You can do it. But think 100 times before you do.
-5

Output:
But think 100 times before you do.
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
