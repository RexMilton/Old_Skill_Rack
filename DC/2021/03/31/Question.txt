Hamming Distance - Two Integers
The program must accept two integer values A and B. Then the program must print the Hamming Distance between them. 
Note: The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the bits are different.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= A, B <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains A and B separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the Hamming Distance between A and B.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12 4

Output:
1

Explanation:
The binary representation of 12 is 1100.
The binary representation of 4  is 0100. 
The bits are different only in the first position.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10 5

Output:
4

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
