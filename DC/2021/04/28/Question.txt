Primary Colors Addition

The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C representing the primary colors (R, G, B) as the input. The value of C is always even. The program must fold the 
given color matrix vertically and print the resulting colours based on the following conditions.
1) Red + Red = Red
2) Green + Green = Green
3) Blue + Blue = Blue
4) Green + Blue = Cyan
5) Red + Blue = Magenta
6) Red + Green = Yellow

Note:
Cyan must be represented as C.
Magenta must be represented as M.
Yellow must be represented as Y.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 6
R G B B G B
B R B G R G
R G R R B R
R R G R G R
G R B R R G

Output:
M G B
C R C
R C R
R Y Y
G R M

Explanation:
1st row -> R+B=M, G+G=G, B+B=B.
2nd row -> B+G=C, R+R=R, B+G=C.
3rd row -> R+R=R, G+B=C, R+R=R.
4th row -> R+R=R, R+G=Y, G+R=Y.
5th row -> G+G=G, R+R=R, B+R=M.
Hence the output is
M G B
C R C
R C R
R Y Y
G R M

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 8
R R B G G B R B
R R B R B G B B
R R G B G G B G
R B G G G R R B

Output:
M R B G
M M C M
Y M G C
M M Y G
