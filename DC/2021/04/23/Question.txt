Classroom - Seating Arrangement
In a classroom, there are R*C chairs arranged as a matrix. There are R*C students and they are grouped based on the marks they score. The groups are numbered from 1 to N. The values of R, C and the number of students in each group are passed as the input. The program must form an integer matrix representing the R*C chairs in the classroom. The class teacher wants to seat the students based on the following conditions.
- The 1st row of the matrix represents the Rth row of the classroom and the Rth row of the matrix represents the 1st row of the classroom.
- The students must sit from the 1st row of the classroom (left to right).
- The order of the students is from the 1st group to the Nth group (i.e., the students who belong to the group 1 must be seated in the first row of the classroom, the students who belong to the group 2 must start from where the previous group ended, then the remaining students must be seated in the remaining rows based on the group).
Finally, the program must print the integer matrix representing the seating arrangement of the classroom, where each integer represents the number of the students in the group as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= Number of students in each group <= 2500

Input Format:
The first line contains R, C and N separated by a space.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 4 3
5 8 7

Output:
3 3 3 3
2 3 3 3
2 2 2 2
1 2 2 2
1 1 1 1

Explanation:
Here N = 3, and the number of students in the 3 groups are 5, 8 and 7.
In the 1st row of the classroom, 4 students from the group 1 are seated.
In the 2st row of the classroom, 1 student from the group 1 and 3 students from the group 2 are seated.
In the 3rd row of the classroom, 4 students from the group 2 are seated.
In the 4th row of the classroom, 1 student from the group 2 and 3 students from the group 3 are seated.
In the 5th row of the classroom, 4 students from the group 3 are seated.
Hence the output is
3 3 3 3
2 3 3 3
2 2 2 2
1 2 2 2
1 1 1 1

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 7 6
12 7 4 8 5 6

Output:
5 6 6 6 6 6 6
4 4 4 5 5 5 5
3 3 4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2 3 3
1 1 1 1 1 2 2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
