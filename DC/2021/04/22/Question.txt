Corona Spread Days

There are N chairs in a line. The program must accept N integer values denoting the seating details in these N chairs. 
- 1 represents a healthy person sitting in a chair.
- 0 represents the chair being empty.
- 2 represents the chair being occupied by a Corona virus infected person.
Each Corona virus infected person will affect the healthy persons sitting adjacent to him/her so that the next day those affected will inturn start infecting their 
healthy adjacent persons. The program must print the number of days D required for the virus to stop spreading and the number of persons H who remain not infected by the 
virus in the end.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 20

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains the N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains D and H separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7
1 1 2 1 0 1 0

Output:
3 1

Explanation:
At the end of the 1st day, the status will be 1 2 2 2 0 1 0.
At the end of the 2nd day, the status will be 2 2 2 2 0 1 0.
On the 3rd day, no infection happens. 
So it takes 3 days for the virus to stop spreading and 1 person remains healthy in the end.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
1 2 1 1 1 1 1

Output:
6 0
