Find Co-ordinates - Other Side
The co-ordinates of two corners of a rectangle representing the bottom or the left are given as the input. The area A of the rectangle is also passed as the input. 
The program must print the co-ordinates of the other two corners. (Assume the edges of the rectangle are always parallel to x-axis or y-axis).

Boundary Condition(s):
-1000 <= x,y co-ordinates <= 1000
1 <= A <= 1000000

Input Format:
The first line contains the co-ordinates of the first corner.
The second line contains the co-ordinates of the second corner.
The third line contains A.

Output Format:
The first line contains the co-ordinates of the third corner.
The second line contains the co-ordinates of the fourth corner.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
0 0
0 5
30

Output:
6 0
6 5

Explanation:
Length is 5. The area is 30. Hence breadth is 30/5 = 6. Based on that the other two co-ordinates are calculated.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2 5
10 5
24

Output:
2 8
10 8

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
3 -5
-2 -5
25

Output:
3 0
-2 0
