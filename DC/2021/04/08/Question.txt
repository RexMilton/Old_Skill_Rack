Matrix - Find Missing Element
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C and an integer S as the input. Exactly one element in the given matrix is missing, which is denoted by the character M. 
The integer S represents the sum of all the integers in the column of the missing element. The program must find the value of M and replace it in the given matrix. Finally, 
the program must print the integer matrix with all the R*C integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000
1 <= S <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines contain the matrix.
The (R+2)nd line contains S.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 3
2 5 8
1 5 M
9 7 6
17

Output:
2 5 8
1 5 3
9 7 6

Explanation:
The missing element is present in the 3rd column.
The sum of integers in the 3rd column is 17.
So the value of the missing element M is 3 (17 - (8 + 6)).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 5
62 25 69 62 80
15 10 17 34 75
99 M 76 79 23
48 15 73 22 68
100

Output:
62 25 69 62 80
15 10 17 34 75
99 50 76 79 23
48 15 73 22 68

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
