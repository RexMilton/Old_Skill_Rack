Shift Down A
A matrix of dimension R*C with alphabets A or B is passed as the input. The program must remove all occurrences of B and shift the occurrences of A down. The empty cells 
must be replaced with hyphens. Then the program must print the modified matrix as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each containing C alphabets separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each containing C characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 4
A A B A
B B A A
A B A A

Output:
- - - A
A - A A
A A A A

Explanation:
After removing all the occurrences of B and replacing the empty cells with hyphens, the matrix becomes
A A - A
- - A A
A - A A
After shifting the occurrences of A down, the matrix becomes
- - - A
A - A A
A A A A

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 5
B A A B B
A A A B A
B A B B A
A A B B B

Output:
- A - - -
- A - - -
A A A - A
A A A - A
