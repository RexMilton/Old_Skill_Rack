Adjust Time - Hours, Minutes, Seconds
The program must accept a time T in 24-hr format (HH:MM:SS) and three integers X, Y, Z as the input. The integer X represents the number of hours to be added to the time T. 
The integer Y represents the number of minutes to be added to the time T. The integer Z represents the number of seconds to be added to the time T. After each adjustment of 
the time (add X hours, add Y minutes and add Z seconds), the program must print the revised time as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y, Z <= 10^6

Input Format:
The first line contains the time T in 24-hr format (HH:MM:SS).
The second line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first three lines, each contains the revised time after each adjustment of the given time.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10:05:45
4 65 100

Output:
14:05:45
15:10:45
15:12:25

Explanation:
Here T = 10:05:45, X = 4, Y = 65 and Z = 100.
After adding 4 hours, the time becomes 14:05:45.
After adding 65 minutes, the time becomes 15:10:45.
After adding 100 seconds, the time becomes 15:12:25.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
23:50:00
3 15 45

Output:
02:50:00
03:05:00
03:05:45

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
