Split String - Equal Unique Count



The program must accept a string S as the input. 
The program must print the number of ways to split 
the string S into two parts so that the number of 
unique characters in both parts are equal.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
acaddabac

Output:
2

Explanation:
All possible ways to split the string acaddabac are given below.
a caddabac
ac addabac
aca ddabac
acad dabac
acadd abac -> Same number of unique characters
acadda bac -> Same number of unique characters
acaddab ac
acaddaba c
Hence the output is 2.
