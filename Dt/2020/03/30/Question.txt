Magical Buckets with Balls 
In a magical room, there are R*C buckets arranged as a matrix. The maximum capacity of each bucket is M. Every second, exactly one ball falls into each bucket in the first row. 
If a bucket overflows, the overflowing balls will double and fall into the bucket below it(at the same time). The number of balls in each bucket and the value of M are passed as 
the input. The program must print the number of seconds it takes to fill all buckets as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
2 <= R, C <= 25 
1 <= M, Number of balls in each bucket <= 1000 

Input Format: 
The first line contains R and C separated by a space. The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space. The (R+2)nd line contains M. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains the number of seconds it takes to fill all buckets. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 
4 5 
3 5 1 3 
2 1 2 4 
4 2 2 4 
3 5 3 2 
3 4 2 1 
5 

Output: 
6 

Explanation: 
After 1 second, the number of balls in the 4*5 buckets become 4 5 2 4 3 1 4 4 4 2 2 4 3 5 3 2 3 4 2 1 
After 2 seconds, the number of balls in the 4*5 buckets become 5 5 3 5 4 1 5 4 4 2 2 5 3 5 3 2 5 4 2 1 
After 3 seconds, the number of balls in the 4*5 buckets become 5 5 4 5 5 3 5 4 5 2 2 5 3 5 3 2 5 4 5 1 
After 4 seconds, the number of balls in the 4*5 buckets become 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 4 2 5 3 5 3 2 5 4 5 1 
After 5 seconds, the number of balls in the 4*5 buckets become 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 4 5 1 
After 6 seconds, the number of balls in the 4*5 buckets become 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 
It takes 6 seconds to fill all buckets. So 6 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2:

Output: 
12
