Positions - Rook & Bishop
The program must accept the position of a rook and the position of a bishop in a chess board of size 8*8 as the input. The program must generate a matrix of 8*8 representing 
the chess board and fill the matrix based on the following conditions.
- The position of the rook must be filled with the character R.
- The position of the bishop must be filled with the character B.
- All positions where the rook can move must be filled with the character r.
- All positions where the bishop can move must be filled with the character b.
- If both rook and bishop meet in a position(other than the positions of the rook and the bishop), then it must be filled with the character x.
- All remaining positions must be filled with 0.
Finally, the program must print the matrix as the output.

Note:
In Chess, rook can move any direction vertically or horizontally. For this program, the movement can happen till the end of the board is reached.
In Chess, bishop can move any direction diagonally. For this program, the movement can happen till the end of the board is reached.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integer values representing the position of a rook in a chess board.
The second line contains two integer values representing the position of a bishop in a chess board.

Output Format:
The lines contain a matrix representing the chess board.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 7
4 3

Output:
0 0 0 0 0 b r 0
b 0 0 0 b 0 r 0
0 b 0 b 0 0 r 0
0 0 B 0 0 0 r 0
0 b 0 b 0 0 r 0
x r r r x r R r
0 0 0 0 0 b r 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 x 0

Explanation:
The position of the rook is (6, 7), which is filled with the character R.
The position of the bishop is (4, 3), which is filled with the character B.
All positions where the rook can move are filled with the character r.
All positions where the bishop can move are filled with the character b.
The positions where both the rook and the bishop meet are give below.
(6, 1), (6, 5) and (8, 7).
So they are filled with the character x.
All remaining positions are filled with 0.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 4
3 5

Output:
0 0 b r 0 0 b 0
0 0 0 x 0 b 0 0
r r r R B r r r
0 0 0 x 0 b 0 0
0 0 b r 0 0 b 0
0 b 0 r 0 0 0 b
b 0 0 r 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 r 0 0 0 0
