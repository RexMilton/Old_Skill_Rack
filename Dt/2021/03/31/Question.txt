Cut Down & Plant - Trees
In a garden, there are N trees from left to right. The height of each tree is passed as input to the program. The gardener wants to cut down T trees completely from left to right, but if he cuts a tree of height H, then he must plant certain number of trees based on the following conditions.
- If H is odd, then he must plant H trees of height ranging from 1 to H on the rightmost end.
- If H is even, then he must plant H/2 trees of height ranging from H/2 to 1 on the rightmost end.
The value of T is also passed as the input to the program. The program must print the number of trees remaining in the garden after cutting down T trees as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Height of each tree <= 50
1 <= T <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.
The third line contains T.

Output Format:
The first line contains the number of trees remaining in the garden after cutting down T trees.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
4 3 5 2
6

Output:
11

Explanation:
After cutting down the 1st tree, the trees in the garden become 3 5 2 2 1.
After cutting down the 2nd tree, the trees in the garden become 5 2 2 1 1 2 3.
After cutting down the 3rd tree, the trees in the garden become 2 2 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5.
After cutting down the 4th tree, the trees in the garden become 2 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 1.
After cutting down the 5th tree, the trees in the garden become 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 1.
After cutting down the 6th tree, the trees in the garden become 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 1 1.
Now 11 trees remaining in the garden, so 11 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
6 4 2 2 5 13 4
10

Output:
29
