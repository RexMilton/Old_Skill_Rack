Max Power Points - Emperor Capturing Countries (Id-2984)

An emperor wages war against other countries and always emerges victorious. When he wins he acquires some power points which depends on the country which has lost and 
also on the countries adjacent to the losing country. Assume the countries are in a straight line adjacent to each other and the emperor starts with zero power points to 
begin with. Each country is assigned a certain number which represents the power point of the country.
When the emperor defeats Country  N, the power points acquired is equal to the product of PowerPoints of Country(N-1) * PowerPoints of Country(N) * PowerPoints of Country(N+1).
If Countries N-1 or N+1 does not exist, then consider their power points to be 1.
The emperor can conquer the countries in any order but can conquer any given country only once. The program must print the maximum power points MAXPP that can be collected 
by the emperor in defeating these N countries.

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains the power points PP(i) of N countries separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains MAXPP

Boundary Conditions:
2 <= N <= 200
1 <= PP <= 10
1 <= MAXPP <= 9999999

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
2 1 4 9

Output:
107
Explanation:
The emperor defeats the countries in the following sequence based on the power points - 1, 4, 2, 9
So when he defeats the country with power point 1, he gets 2*1*4 = 8 PPs. Now the remaining countries power points are 2 4 9.
So when he defeats the country with power point 4, he gets 2*4*9 = 72 PPs. Now the remaining countries power points are 2 9.
Now when he defeats the country with power point 2, he gets 1*2*9 = 18 PPs. (As there is no country to the left, we multiply it by 1). Now only the country with power 
point 9 is left.
So when he defeats the last country with PP 9, he gets 1*9*1 = 9 PPs. (As there are no countries on the left or right we multiply by 1).
So total PPs = 8+72+18+9 = 107).
You can verify no other sequence gives power points more than 107.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2
5 9
Output:
54
