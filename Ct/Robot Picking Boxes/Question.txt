Robot Picking Boxes (Id-3050)

Robots are used to automate the process of picking up mobile phone boxes and relocating them within a warehouse. The boxes are stacked and arranged adjacently. All the 
stacks may not have equal number of boxes.
The robot can collect and pickup boxes either vertically (boxes in a single stack) or horizontally (across multiple stacks). But when picking up boxes horizontally, the 
robot can pick up only the boxes in continous stacks in a single attempt. Given the number of stacks N and the count of boxes in each stack, the program must print the 
minimum number of attempts M required to pick (collect) and relocate all the boxes.

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains the number of boxes B(1), B(2), ... B(N) in the N stacks separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains M (which is the minimum number of attempts)

Boundary Conditions:
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= B(i) <= 50

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
5 4 4 3 4 4

Output:
6

Explanation:
The boxes are stacked as given below where each asterisk is a box.

As the robot can pick only continuous boxes in a single attempt, at least 6 attempts are required.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10
5 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 5

Output:
6

Example Input/Output 3:
