Max Same Letter Square Size (Id-2763)
 
Certain kids were playing a game in which they would draw a N*N matrix and would fill in a letter from A to Z in a given cell based on certain rules. Without getting into the details of those rules, the final values present in the N*N matrix is passed as the input to the program. The program must print the size of the largest square sub-matrix which has all the letters equal in it.

Input Format:
The first line will contain N.
The next N lines will each contain N letters separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line will contain the size of the largest square sub-matrix with all the letters equal in it.

Boundary Conditions:
3 <= N <= 50

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
A H K L O
J H H B U
Q H H H Z
I E H H W
F H H W Z

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two 2*2 sub-matrices filled with H are the largest.
