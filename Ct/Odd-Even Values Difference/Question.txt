Odd-Even Values Difference (Id-2707) 

Given a value of N positive integers, the program must print the difference between the sum of odd integers and the sum of even integers. 

Input Format: 
The first line will contain the value of N The second line will contain the N positive integers separated by a space. 

Output Format: 
The first line will contain the integer value denoting the difference. 

Constraints: 
2 <= N <= 25 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 
5 
10 11 20 33 1 

Output: 
15 

Explanation: 
The sum of odd integers is = 11+33+1 = 45. The sum of even integers is = 10+20 = 30. Hence the difference 45-30 = 15 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 
6 
2 24 7 35 5 30 

Output: 
-9 

Explanation: 
The sum of odd integers is = 7+35+5 = 47 The sum of even integers is = 2+24+30 = 56 Hence the difference 47-56 = -9 is printed as the output.
