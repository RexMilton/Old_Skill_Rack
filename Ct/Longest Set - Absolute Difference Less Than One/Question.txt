Longest Set - Absolute Difference Less Than One (Id-2713) 

An array of N integers is passed as input. The program must print the length of the longest set of integers among the N numbers so that the absolute difference between 
any two integers in the set does not exceed 1. 

Input Format: 
The first line will contain the value of N which represents the count of integers to be passed as input. 
The second line will contain N integer value separated by a space. 

Output Format: 
The first line will contain the integer value denoting the longest set of integers meeting the given criteria. 

Constraints: 
3 <= N <= 10000 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 
9 
1 3 2 1 4 2 1 5 3 

Output: 
5 

Explanation: 
The longest set meeting the condition is {1,2,1,2,1} 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 
6 
1 2 3 4 5 3 

Output: 
3 

Explanation: The longest set meeting the condition is {3,4,3}
