Sum of two primes (Id-1758) 

Write a program to find if a given number N can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers. 

Note: YOU MUST OPTIMIZE the logic to find whether a number is prime or not, as very large prime numbers are provided as input. 
If the logic is not optimized your program will NOT get executed within the given time limit. 

Input Format: 

First line contains total number of test cases, denoted by T Next T lines will contain the value of N for each testcase. 

Output Format: 

T lines containing either yes or no 

Boundary Conditions / Constraints: 

1 <= T <= 25 
3 <= N <= 10^9 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

5 
20 
12 
23 
34 
16 

Output: 

yes 
yes 
no 
yes 
yes 

Explanation: 

20 can be expressed as 17+3 
12 can be expressed as 7+5 
23 cannot be expressed as sum of two primes 
34 can be expressed as 31+3 or 11+23 or 17+17 
16 can be expressed as 11+5 

Max Execution Time Limit: 10000 millisecs
