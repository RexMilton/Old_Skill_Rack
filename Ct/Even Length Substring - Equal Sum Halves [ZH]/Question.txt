Even Length Substring - Equal Sum Halves [ZH] (Id-2943)

Given a string S as input which consists only of digits from 0 to 9, print the longest substring such that the sum of the digits in the first half and the second half is 
the same. Print -1 if such a substring does not exist.

Input Format:
The first line contains S

Output Format:
The first line contains the longest substring as per the rules defined above or -1.

Boundary Conditions:
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
123123

Output:
123123

Explanation:
The first half is 123 and the second half is 123. Hence the sum of the digits is equal.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1538024

Output:
5380

Explanation:
The first half is 53 and the second half is 80. The sum of the digits is 8 in both the halves.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
12345

Output:
-1

Example Input/Output 4:
Input:
989898989

Output:
98989898
Explanation:
Here both 98989898 and 89898989 are of same length. But due to order of occurrence 98989898 is printed as the output.
