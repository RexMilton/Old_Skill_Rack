Farmers & Grocery Shop Owner Agreement (Id-2820)

A group of farmers in a village and a grocery shop owner enter into an agreement containing the following conditions.
- The price of the item sold by farmers will be monitored over a period of N days.
- The grocery shop owner will pay the price P which was higher than or equal to the previous days pricing for the maximum consecutive days.
- If there are multiple such values for P, then the first occurring price will be considered for P.
The program must accept the input values and print the price P which is to be paid by the grocery shop owner to the farmers.

Note: You must optimize the program to complete it within the given time limit. Else "Timeout" will occur.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 1000000

Input Format:
First line contains N.
Second line contains N positive integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
First line contains the price to be paid.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7
90 70 60 72 65 75 85

Output:
85

Explanation:
90 was the highest price for 1 day (As there was no previous pricing)
70 was the highest price for just 1 day (As the previous day pricing 90 is more than 70).
60 was the highest price for just 1 day (As the previous day pricing 70 is more than 60 ).
72 was the highest price for 3 days (72 is higher than 70, 60).
Similarly 65 was the highest price for 1 day.
75 was the highest price for 5 days and
85 was the highest price for 6 days.
Hence 85 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
100 80 90 95 90 82 93

Output:
95

Explanation:
Though 95 and 93 both were the highest price for 3 days, the first occurring price which is 95 is printed as the output.

Max Execution Time Limit: 3000 millisecs
