Sum divisible by D (Id-2349) 

Two numbers A and B are passed as input. The program must print yes if the sum of these two numbers A and B is divisible by a third number D. 
The program must print no if the sum of these two numbers A and B is NOT divisible by D. 

Input Format: 

The first line denotes the value of A. The second line denotes the value of B. The third line denotes the value of D. 

Output Format: 

The first line either contains yes or no (The output is case SENSITIVE) 

Boundary Conditions: 

1 <= A <= 9999999 
1 <= B <= 9999999 
2 <= D <= 50 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

50 
40 
9 

Output: 

yes 

Explanation: 

The sum of 50 and 40 is 90 which is divisible by 9. Hence the program prints yes. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 

80 
3 
20 

Output: 

no
