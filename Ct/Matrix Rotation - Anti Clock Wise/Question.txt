Matrix Rotation - Anti Clock Wise (Id-2738) 

A M*N matrix having M rows and N columns containing integer values is passed as the input. The matrix must be rotated R times in counter-clock (anti-clock) wise 
direction and the resulting matrix must be printed as the output. 

Input Format: 
The first line will contain the value of M, N and R, each separated by a space. (M is the number of rows, N is the number of cols and R is the rotation count) 
The next M lines will contain N integer values 

Output Format: 
M lines with each line containing N integer values of the rotated matrix (with each value separated by a space). 

Constraints: 
2 <= M <= 300 
2 <= N <= 300 
1 <= R <= 10^9 
Values of integers in the matrix is from 1 to 10000000
