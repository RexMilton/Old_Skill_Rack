Keyboard Switch Count
There are three rows in a keyboard containing the alphabets. The alphabets in each row are given as the input. 
The string S containing the alphabets to be typed is passed as the input. The program must print the number of times, the switch must happen to type the alphabets. 
Assume initially the position is in the middle row.

Note: Assume S contains only lower case alphabets and no special characters will be present in S.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first three lines contain the alphabets in the three rows of a keyboard.
The fourth line contains S.

Outupt Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the switch count.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
qwertyuiop
asdfghjkl
zxcvbnm
coding

Output:
8

Explanation:
The string to be typed is coding.
c - bottom row. Hence switch count is 1.
o - top row. So switch count = 1+2 = 3.
d - middle row. So switch count = 3+1 = 4.
i - top row. So switch count = 4+1 = 5.
n - bottom row. So switch count = 5+2 = 7.
g - middle row. So switch count = 7+1 = 8.
So 8 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
qwertyuiop
asdfghjkl
zxcvbnm
gasstation

Output:
5
