ProgramID- 12607

Extended Divisibility
The program must accept two integer values N and K as the input. The program must form a list of integers. The first value in the list is N. If N is divisible by K, then 
the integer value N/K must be added to the list for K times. Then the program must repeat the process for all the newly added integers in the list. Finally, the program 
must print the integer values in the list as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^5
2 <= K <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the integer values in the list separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 2

Output:
4 2 2 1 1 1 1

Explanation:
Here N=4 and K=2
Initially the list contains 4.
N is divisible by K, so 2 (4/2) is added to the list K times.
The newly added values are 2 2 and divisible by K=2.
Hence 2/2 = 1 is added K times for each 2. Hence 1 is added 4 times.
The newly added values are 1 1 1 1 and they are not divisible by K=2.
Hence we stop. Now the values in the list are 4 2 2 1 1 1 1 and printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10 5

Output:
10 2 2 2 2 2

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
7 5

Output:
7
