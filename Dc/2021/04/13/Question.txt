Max among K-Set
The program must accept N integers and an integer K as the input. The program must print the maximum among each set of integers of size K. If the last set does not contain 
K integers, then ignore the set.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= K <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.
The third line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains the integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10
2 55 88 14 678 455 9899 12 545 222
4

Output:
88 9899

Explanation:
Here N = 10 and K = 4.
The maximum integer among the first 4 integers is 88 (2, 55, 88, 14). So 88 is printed.
The maximum integer among the next 4 integers is 9899 (678, 455, 9899, 12). So 9899 is printed.
The last set contains only two integers, so the last set is ignored.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10
2 55 88 14 678 455 9899 12 545 222
5

Output:
678 9899
