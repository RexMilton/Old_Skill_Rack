Points Inside Rectangle 
The program must accept the coordinates(x, y) of N points on a graph as the input. The program must print the number of points present inside the given rectangle as the output. 
The coordinates of the top-left and the bottom-right corners of the rectangle are passed as the input. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
2 <= N <= 100 
-10 <= x, y <= 10 

Input Format: 
The first line contains N. The next N lines, each contains two integers separated by a space. 
The (N+2)th line contains four integers representing the coordinates of the top-left and the bottom-right corners of the rectangle. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains an integer representing the number of points present inside the given rectangle. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 
5 
2 2 
4 1 
1 3 
4 3 
7 2 
2 4 6 1 

Output: 
3 

Explanation: 
The coordinates of the top-left corner = (2, 4). The coordinates of the bottom-right corner = (6, 1). There are 3 points present inside the rectangle which are given below. 
(2, 2), (4, 1) and (4, 3). 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 
8 
-1 -5 
-2 -3 
-3 -2 
-3 -3 
-4 -1 
-5 -5 
-3 -1 
-4 -4 
-3 0 0 -4 

Output: 
4
