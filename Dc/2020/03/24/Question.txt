Interface Implementation - Pair 

You must define the class Node which implements the interface Pair so that program runs successfully. The class Hello accepts two integers as the input. 
It prints the HCF of the given two integers as shown in the Example Input/Output section. Then it prints the string value "YES" if the given two integers are co-prime. 
Else it prints the string value "NO". 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

21 22 

Output: 

HCF: 1 
YES 

Explanation: The HCF of the given two integers is 1. So the given integers are co-prime. Hence the output is HCF: 1 YES 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 

21 27 

Output: 

HCF: 3 
NO
