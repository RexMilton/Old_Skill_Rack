Daily Challenge  Program Id-12922

Mixed Matrix - Integers & Characters 

The program must accept a matrix of size R*C containing integers and characters as the input. The program must print the sum of all the integers in the given matrix. 
Then the program must print a string representing the characters in the given matrix. The string must be formed by traversing the columns of the matrix from left to right, 
where each column must be traversed from top to bottom. Note: At least one character is always present in the given matrix. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

2 <= R, C <= 50 
1 <= Value of each integer in the matrix <= 1000 

Input Format: 

The first line contains R and C separated by a space. The next R lines, each contains C values (integers and characters) separated by a space. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains an integer representing the sum of all the integers in the matrix. 
The second line contains a string representing all the characters in the matrix based on the given conditions. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

4 5 
50 i 2 41 7 
s 47 l 30 a 
k 41 3 42 c 
75 l r 79 k 

Output: 

417 
skillrack 

Explanation: 

The sum of integers in the given matrix is 417 (50 + 2 + 41 + 7 + 47 + 30 + 41 + 3 + 42 + 75 + 79). The string formed using the characters in the given matrix is skillrack.
