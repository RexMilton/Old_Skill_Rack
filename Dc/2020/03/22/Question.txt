Daily Challenge ProgramID- 12932
Shift Characters Upwards
The program must accept N string values of equal length L and an integer K as the input. The program must perform the following operation K times.
- Shift the middle L-2 characters towards the top by one position among the given N string values.
Finally, the program must print the N modified string values as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
3 <= Length of each string <= 100
1 <= K <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains a string value.
The (N+2)nd line contains K.

Output Format:
The first N lines containing the N modified string values.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5

office
travel
1

Output:
ccrosg
axpers
effict
oravee
todinl

Explanation:
Here N = 5 and K = 1.
The length of each string is 6.
K = 1: After shifting the middle 4(6-2) characters towards the top by one position, the string values become
ccrosg
axpers
effict
oravee
todinl
