Daily Challenge ProgramID- 12762 
Binary - Case Sensitive Decryption
The program must accept a string S representing an encrypted message as the input. The program must decrypt the string S and print the message based on the following conditions.
- The program must split the string S into substrings of equal length 5.
- For each substring, the program must form a binary representation by replacing the lower case alphabets with 0 and the upper case alphabets with 1. Then the program must find the decimal equivalent of each binary representation and replace them with the characters as given below.
From 0 to 25 -> a to z.
26 -> . (dot)
27 -> , (comma)
28 -> a SPACE character
29 -> ? (question mark symbol)
30 -> ' (single quote)
31 -> " (double quote)

Note: The string S contains only alphabets and its length is always a multiple of 5.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the decrypted string based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcDEtSAYtmaRKs

Output:
dog

Explanation:
The given string is abcDEtSAYtmaRKs.
The 1st substring is abcDE. The binary representation is 00011. 3 -> d.
The 2nd substring is tSAYt. The binary representation is 01110. 14 -> o.
The 3rd substring is maRKs. The binary representation is 00110. 6 -> g.
So the decrypted string is dog, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
EytWGeqNKYcbNpqLSXcoAHCUIbgrarZzcpRPvoYGYOQIUQAsHh

Output:
the "art".
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
