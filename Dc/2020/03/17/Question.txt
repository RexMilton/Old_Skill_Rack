Construction of New Buildings 

The program must accept a character of size R*C representing a city as the input. The matrix consists of asterisks and hyphens. 
Each asterisk represents a building and each hyphen represents a land. The government has planned to construct new buildings in the city based on the following condition. 
- If a land is present in one of the four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right) of a building, then a new building is allowed to construct on that land. 
The program must print the maximum number of new buildings that can be built based on the given conditions. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

2 <= R, C <= 50 

Input Format: 

The first line contains R and C separated by a space. 
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains the maximum number of new buildings that can be built. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

5 6 
- - * - * - 
- * - - - * 
* - - - - * 
- * - - - * 
* * * * - - 

Output: 

10 

Explanation: 

The 10 new buildings can be constructed as given below. 

# - * - * - 
- * - # # * 
* - # - # * 
# * # # # * 
* * * * # - 

Each hash symbol in the above matrix represents a new building. So 10 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 

3 3 
- * -
