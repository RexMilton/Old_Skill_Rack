Daily Test Program Id-12802

Longest Substring - Odd & Even Digits 

The program must accept a string S containing only digits as the input. The program must print the longest substring with alternating odd/even or even/odd digits. 
If two or more substrings have the same length, then the program must print the substring that occurs first. 

Note: 
At least one odd digit and one even digit are always present in the string S. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
2 <= Length of S <= 1000 

Input Format: 
The first line contains S. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains the longest substring with alternating odd/even or even/odd digits. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 
336535383274365585552449775932 

Output: 
383274365 

Explanation:
Here the given string is 336535383274365585552449775932. The longest substring with alternating odd/even digits is highlighted below. 
336535383274365585552449775932 So 383274365 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 
001234567890098765432100 

Output: 
01234567890
