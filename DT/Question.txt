Theater Seating Slots 

The booking status of R*C seats in a theatre is passed as the input. 1 indicates that the seat is booked and 0 indicates that the seat is not booked yet. The R*C seats are divided into three blocks column wise. 
The number of seats in a row of each block (X, Y and Z) is passed as the input (i.e., C = X + Y + Z). A family with K members wants to book continuous seats in the same row. 
The program must print the number of ways the family can book the seats as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

1 <= R <= 50 
3 <= C <= 50 
X + Y + Z = C (X, Y and Z are always greater than 0) 
1 <= K <= Maximum value among X, Y and Z. 

Input Format:

The first line contains R, C and K separated by a space. 
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space. The (R+2)th line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains an integer representing the number of ways the family can book the seats. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

5 12 3 
1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 
1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 
1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 
3 6 3 

Output: 

6 

Explanation: 

Here K = 3, X = 3, Y = 6 and Z = 3. 
The 5*12 seats can be divided into 3 blocks as given below. 

1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 
1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 
1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 

In the block 1, there is only 1 possible way to book 3 seats in a row. 
In the block 2, there are 5 possible ways to book 3 seats in a row. In the block 3, there is no way to book 3 seats in a row.
So the total number of ways is 6, which is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 

4 6 2 
1 0 0 0 1 1 
1 0 0 1 0 0 
1 0 1 0 1 0 
0 0 0 1 1 1 
2 3 1 

Output: 

2
