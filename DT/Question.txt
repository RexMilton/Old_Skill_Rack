Submatrix with Maximum Sum - Border
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C as the input. The program must print the 2*2 submatrix that occurs in the border of the given matrix and having 
the maximum sum. If two or more such submatrices having the same maximum sum, then the program must print the first occurring 2*2 submatrix in clockwise direction as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the 2*2 submatrix that occurs in the border of the given matrix and having the maximum sum.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 5
5 1 9 1 7
4 5 8 4 4
1 4 8 3 5
6 4 7 5 3

Output:
1 9
5 8

Explanation:
There are three 2*2 submatrices that occur in the border and having the same maximum sum as 23.
1 9
5 8

8 3
7 5

4 8
4 7

So the first occurring 2*2 submatrix in clockwise direction is printed as the output.
1 9
5 8

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 5
22 15 20 21 18
19 13 10 12 18
11 18 28 10 16
10 10 12 23 15
24 16 19 16 13

Output:
12 23
19 16
