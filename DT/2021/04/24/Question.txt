Program ID-13011

Matrix - Replace Adjacent Cells

The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C and a character CH as the input. For each occurrence of CH in the given matrix, the program must modify the matrix 
by replacing the characters in the 8 adjacent cells with CH if they are all not equal to CH. Else the program must not modify the matrix for that occurrence of CH. Finally, 
the program must print the modified matrix as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2)nd line contains CH.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 5
f a b r s
a h t u a
e d j y p
v c n i u
q j d a f
q e y f y
a

Output:
f a b a a
a h t a a
e d j a a
v c a a a
q j a a a
q e a a a

Explanation:
Here CH = 'a'.
All the occurrences of 'a' in the given matrix are highlighted below.
f a b r s
a h t u a
e d j y p
v c n i u
q j d a f
q e y f y
There are only two occurrences of 'a' where the adjacent cells are not equal to 'a'.
After modifying the matrix based on the given conditions, the matrix becomes
f a b a a
a h t a a
e d j a a
v c a a a
q j a a a
q e a a a
