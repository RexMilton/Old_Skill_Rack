ProgramID- 12716
 
Combinations - Insert + or -
The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must insert + or - between adjacent integers so that the value of the expression is S and print the count of 
such possible combinations.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 20
Each integer value is from 1 to 1000.
0 <= S <= 30000

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the count of possible combinations based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
4 2 8 9 3
10

Output:
1

Explanation:
Here the desired sum S is 10.
Only one combination of 4+2-8+9+3 = 10 is possible.
Hence 1 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
5 5 5 5 5
15

Output:
4

Max Execution Time Limit: 200 millisecs
