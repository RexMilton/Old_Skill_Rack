Irrigation - Gardening
There are N trees planted circularly in a garden. The gardener wants to supply at least 1 litre of water for each tree. The tall trees get more water than the tree on the 
left. The program must accept N integers representing the heights of N trees as the input. The program must print the minimum amount of water (in litres) the gardener needs 
as the output.

Note: The two adjacent trees are not the same height.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Height of each tree <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the minimum amount of water (in litres) the gardener needs.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8
10 20 30 40 30 20 40 60

Output:
17

Explanation:
Here N = 8.
1st tree - 1 litre
2nd tree - 2 litres (20 > 10)
3rd tree - 3 litres (30 > 20)
4th tree - 4 litres (40 > 30)
5th tree - 1 litre
6th tree - 1 litre
7th tree - 2 litres (40 > 20)
8th tree - 3 litres (60 > 40)
The minimum amount of water (in litres) the gardener needs is 17 litres.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
6 8 6 7 8 4

Output:
12

Explanation:
Here N = 6.
1st tree - 2 litres (6 > 4)
2nd tree - 3 litres (8 > 6)
3rd tree - 1 litre
4th tree - 2 litres (7 > 6)
5th tree - 3 litres (8 > 7)
6th tree - 1 litre
The minimum amount of water (in litres) the gardener needs is 12 litres.
