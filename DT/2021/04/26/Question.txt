Daily Test ProgramID- 13075 


Replace Submatrix with Average
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The program must find the first occurring submatrix of size K*K where the sum is 
divisible by K*K. Then the program must replace each integer in the submatrix with its average. Finally, the program must print the modified matrix as the output. If 
there is no such submatrix, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 10^5
2 <= K <= Minimum value between R and C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.
The (R+2)nd line contains K.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 5
6 8 7 9 3
7 1 5 1 4
2 5 6 3 6
3 9 9 1 7
3

Output:
6 5 5 5 3
7 5 5 5 4
2 5 5 5 6
3 9 9 1 7

Explanation:
Here K = 3.
The first occurring submatrix of size 3*3 where the sum is divisible by 9 is highlighted below.
6 8 7 9 3
7 1 5 1 4
2 5 6 3 6
3 9 9 1 7
The sum of integers in the submatrix is 45 (8+7+9+1+5+1+5+6+3) which is divisible by 9 (3*3). So the submatrix is replaced with its average 5 (45/9).
After modifying the submatrix, the matrix becomes
6 5 5 5 3
7 5 5 5 4
2 5 5 5 6
3 9 9 1 7

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:

2 5 4 3 2 8
8 1 2 5 7 4
2 1 4 9 6 6
1 2 4 4 9 8
9 2 6 9 6 4
3 5 1 1 8 4

Output:
-1
