HCF Triplets
The program must accept 3 array elements with the size of the arrays as A, B and C. The program must find the count N of the triplets P, Q and R where P belongs to A, Q 
belongs to B and R belongs to C and one of them is the HCF of the other two values.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= A, B, C <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains A, B and C separated by a space.
The second line contains A integer values separated by a space.
The third line contains B integer values separated by a space.
The fourth line contains C integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains N.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 2 2
10 5 2
4 3
5 2

Output:
2

Explanation:
The possible combinations of the triplets are
(10,4,5) (10,4,2) (10,3,5) (10,3,2)
(5,4,5) (5,4,2) (5,3,5) (5,3,2)
(2,4,5) (2,4,2) (2,3,5) (2,3,2)
In triplet (10,4,2), 2 is the HCF of 10 and 4.
In triplet (2,4,2), 2 is the HCF of 4 and 2.
As there are 2 such triplets, 2 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2 7 3
8 12
4 8 9 1 12 16 11
12 8 10

Output:
5

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
