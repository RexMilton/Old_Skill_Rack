Form Integers - Unit Digits Circularly

The program must accept a list of N integers as the input. The program must form another list of integers based on the following conditions.
- The 1st integer is formed using the unit digits of the first three integers. After forming the 1st integer, the unit digits must be removed from those three integers.
- The 2nd integer is formed using the unit digits of the next three integers. After forming the 2nd integer, the unit digits must be removed from those three integers.
- The 3rd integer is formed using the unit digits of the next three integers. After forming the 3rd integer, the unit digits must be removed from those three integers.
- Similarly, the program must form the integers using the unit digits of every three integers circularly.
- Once all the digits of an integer are removed, then the integer itself removed from the given integers.
- An integer is formed only if at least 3 integers are present in the list (i.e., it stops forming the integers when the number of integers in the given list is less than 3).
Finally, the program must print the sum of integers in the new list as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of integers in the list.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
12 45798 60 90 598 1567

Output:
2314

Explanation:
280 -> 1st integer is formed using the unit digits of 12, 45798 and 60.
Now the given integers become 1 4579 6 90 598 1567
87 -> 2nd integer is formed using the unit digits of 90, 598 and 1567.
Now the given integers become 1 4579 6 9 59 156
196 -> 3rd integer is formed using the unit digits of 1, 4579 and 6.
Now the given integers become 457 9 59 156
996 -> 4th integer is formed using the unit digits of 9, 59 and 156.
Now the given integers become 457 5 15
755 -> 5th integer is formed using the unit digits of 457, 5 and 15.
Now the given integers become 45 1
The number of integers in the given list is reduced to 2, which is less than 3.
The sum of the obtained integers is 2314 (280 + 87 + 196 + 996 + 755).
So 2314 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
123 456 789

Output:
774

Explanation:
369 -> 1st integer is formed using the unit digits of 123, 456 and 789.
Now the given integers become 12 45 78
258 -> 2nd integer is formed using the unit digits of 12, 45 and 78.
Now the given integers become 1 4 7
147 -> 3rd integer is formed using the unit digits of 1, 4 and 7.
The sum of the obtained integers is 774 (369 + 258 + 147).
So 774 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
3254 50847 828 7125

Output:
2442
