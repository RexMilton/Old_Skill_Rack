Double X Pattern - String
The program must accept a string S as the input. The length of the string S is always odd. The program must print the double X pattern based on the following conditions.
- The string S must be printed diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right two times(one below the other).
- Similarly, the string S must be printed diagonally from the top-right to the bottom-left two times(one below the other).
- The empty spaces must be printed as asterisks.

Boundary Condition(s):
5 <= Length of S <= 99

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first (L+1) lines contain the double X pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output section (L represents the length of the string S).

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack

Output:
s*******s
sk*****ks
*ki***ik*
**il*li**
***lll***
***rlr***
**ar*ra**
*ca***ac*
kc*****ck
k*******k

Explanation:
The given string S = skillrack, which is printed based on the given conditions.
Hence the output is
s*******s
sk*****ks
*ki***ik*
**il*li**
***lll***
***rlr***
**ar*ra**
*ca***ac*
kc*****ck
k*******k

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
WATER

Output:
W***W
WA*AW
*ATA*
*ETE*
RE*ER
R***R
