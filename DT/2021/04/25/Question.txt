String Values with Matrix Element
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C containing unique integers and R*C string values as the input. Each string contains the matrix element at the 
beginning or end. The program must print the string values in the matrix format based on the following conditions.
- If a string has the matrix element at its beginning, then the string must be printed in the position of the matrix element.
- If a string has the matrix element at its end, then the reverse of the string must be printed in the position of the matrix element.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 10^4
2 <= Length of each string <= 25

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.
The next R*C lines from the (R+2)nd line, each contains a string value.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C string values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2 3
73 37 84
72 19 88
72jackfruit
73apple
egnaro88
37mango
separg19
84pineapple

Output:
apple mango pineapple
jackfruit grapes orange

Explanation:
The string 72jackfruit contains 72 at its beginning, so jackfruit is printed in the position of 72.
The string 73apple contains 73 at its beginning, so apple is printed in the position of 73.
The string egnaro88 contains 88 at its end, so orange is printed in the position of 88.
The string 37mango contains 37 at its beginning, so mango is printed in the position of 37.
The string separg19 contains 19 at its end, so grapes is printed in the position of 19.
The string 84pineapple contains 84 at its beginning, so pineapple is printed in the position of 84.
Hence the output is
apple mango pineapple
jackfruit grapes orange
